# Looking for new maintainer
As of November 2021, I am no longer maintaining ScratchFormat. I have no motivation  
to work on it as I do not use Scratch anymore. If you want to continue my work, please  
send me an email at brikbusters@gmail.com.

ScratchFormat is a browser extension created in 2017 to make Scratch comments
